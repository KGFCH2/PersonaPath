## Deploying to Vercel (using Docker)

This repo includes `vercel.json` and a `Dockerfile` so Vercel can build and deploy the app using Docker. Vercel will use the Dockerfile to build the image and run the container.

Quick steps:

1. Install the Vercel CLI and login (optional): `vercel login`
2. From the project root run `vercel` and follow prompts.

Test locally with Docker:

```powershell
docker build -t personapath:local .
docker run -p 5000:5000 personapath:local
# then open http://localhost:5000
```

Notes:

- Set any environment variables in the Vercel Project Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables.
- The app is served by `gunicorn` in the Dockerfile.
